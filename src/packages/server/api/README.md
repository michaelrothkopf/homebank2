# API Routes

The API routes folder contains all of the backend API routes. This uses the format in [example.ts](example.ts) and is read by [loadApiRoutes.ts](../loadApiRoutes.ts).

To be loaded, files must have the `.ts` or `.js` extensions, checked using this regular expression: `/\.(ts|js)$/gm`.
